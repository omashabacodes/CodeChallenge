//You may have heard the term object before.

//Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, you access the data in objects through what are called properties.

//Here's a sample object:

var cat = {
  "name": "Whiskers",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "enemies": ["Water", "Dogs"]
};
//Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way, and can represent real world objects, like a cat.

//Instructions
//Make an object that represents a dog called myDog which contains the properties name (a string), legs, tails and friends.
//You can set these object properties to whatever values you want, as long "name" is a string, "legs" and "tails" are numbers, and "friends" is an array.

//Before
// Example
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

// Only change code below this line.

var myDog = {




};
